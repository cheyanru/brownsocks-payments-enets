Implementation details
----------------------
This library is a clean-room implementation of the UMAPI protocol provided by eNets.

Due to the limitations in the official eNets Java client, the implementation has been
re-done from scratch in this project. This means that none of the official eNets provided
code is required, except for the initial key generation (see below).


Usage example
----------------------
See src/test/Test.java for a simple example.


Generating PGP keys
----------------------
Included with this library are the public and private keys for the test server as well as the eNets live
server public key.

All you need is to generate your own public/private key pair for the production environment.

You will need to use the key generation tool provided in the java download by eNets. We have not 
re-implemented this tool.

Your public key must then be uploaded through enets administration web console.
